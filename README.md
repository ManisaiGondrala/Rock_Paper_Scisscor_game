# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The user plays against the computer, and the game follows standard rules to determine the winner.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. The game will prompt you if you want to play (`Y` for Yes, `N` for No).
3. If you choose to play:
   - Enter `1` for Rock
   - Enter `2` for Paper
   - Enter `3` for Scissors
4. The game will then display the choices made by both the user and the computer and declare the winner.

## Game Rules

- Rock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beats Paper.
- Paper beats Rock.
- If both the user and the computer choose the same option, it's a draw.
